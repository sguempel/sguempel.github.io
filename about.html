            <h3>Senior Salesforce Consultant, Certified Salesforce Administrator &amp; Registered Nurse</h3>
              <p>Self-driven with a deep passion for solving complex problems. I strive to find the best long-term solutions so I can build reliability, and through that reliability, trust in our services, and team.  My drive to find the best solutions inspired me to become a Registered Nurse where I first learned the importance of effective communication, compassion, flexibility, and not only listening to but understanding the problems my patients were going through. As a nurse, I understood I couldn't solve every patient's problem. However, I always did my best to make sure they knew that they were cared for emotionally and physically.</p>
              <p>As a Program Manager at United BioSource, I helped find solutions not only for patients and clients, but worked on the needs of my own nursing team. I wanted my team to enjoy coming to work and be proud of the program we were representing, while delivering the expected quality results for our client. Our client wanted to increase outreach and adherence for our care program in which I assisted by testing, training, and implementing improved documentation software that increased productivity. This journey introduced me to the Salesforce platform.</p>
              <p>My experience with Salesforce lead me to my position as a Senior Solution Designer and Test Analyst for Cerner Corporation. I focused on representing the end user for our product, and verifying that the functional enhancements met the requirements. I dove deeper into Salesforce and passed the Salesforce Administrator Certification, becoming one of the subject matter experts of Salesforce for our product.</p>
              <p>I am proud of my past experiences because they have led me to become a Senior Salesforce Consultant, where I can continue to remove pain points, and help create solutions that clients want. My past experience has also allowed me to feel comfortable working with cross-functional teams, spanning from developers and UX designers, to clinical providers and pharmaceutical clients. My clinical background empowers me in providing more understanding of the end user experience, as well as risk considerations related to healthcare. My time spent collaborating with the development and product teams introduced me to understanding our client's journeys, and the product lifecycle. In summary, I am able to offer a unique and dynamic experience in a collaborative setting, and the self-drive to accomplish goals set before me.</p>
