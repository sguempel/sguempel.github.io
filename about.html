            <h3>Nursing Experience</h3>
              <p> As a Salesforce Consultant and Registered Nurse specializing in health and life sciences, I bring a unique fusion of clinical insight and technical expertise to every project. My background enables me to design and implement tailored Salesforce solutions that streamline business processes and elevate client outcomes. Leading all Salesforce projects at J2 Interactive, I drive innovation and efficiency, delivering measurable results for our clients. </p> 
             <p></p>        
          
             <h3> Transition to Health Technology</h3>  

                  
            
             <p>As I became more involved, I started creating reports and analyzing data to drive improvements in our program, which eventually led to my promotion to manager. In this role, I grew our team from 6 to 20 nurses. It was during this time that I was introduced to Salesforce. I actively contributed to its implementation by identifying team pain points, defining requirements, and assisting in user testing—a unique opportunity to apply both my clinical insight and interest in technology.
             </p>      
             <p>This dual focus on clinical care and technology ultimately led me to join Cerner (now Oracle) as a business and test analyst on the Salesforce development team. I worked on developing a new product that helped clients integrate their data within Salesforce Health Cloud. My responsibilities included creating requirements for RESTful APIs, performing hazard analyses to protect sensitive patient data, and ensuring HIPAA compliance. This role gave me a solid grounding in interoperability and data integration, ultimately leading to my advancement to Product Manager, where I crafted product roadmaps to address evolving healthcare system needs.</p>  
                    
                     </p>
                     </div>

          <h3>Nursing Experience</h3>

        </div>
        
           
          <p>Fueled by a deep commitment to improving patient care, I began my journey as a Medical Oncology nurse. In this role, I saw firsthand the dedication of healthcare professionals and the systemic barriers that can stand in the way of the best possible outcomes.</p>            
 <p>Looking to make an impact in a different way, I transitioned to a Nurse Educator role within a contact center’s drug adherence program, focusing on patients with alcohol and opioid dependency. My background in oncology and pain management allowed me to support patients through complex and often emotional conversations, blending empathy with my technical nursing skills. This experience ignited a passion for combining clinical expertise with innovation.</p>
